# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned features and improvements. Timelines are rough estimates and will probably change.

## Current Focus
### walkToTarget Improvements
- Keep fixing and improving the walkToTarget function
- Better pathfinding that doesn't get stuck as much
- Less random exits and weird behavior

## Next Major Update (v0.3.0)
### Legit Mode for Auto Farm
- Finish implementing legit mode for auto farming
- Make it look more human-like
- Add timing variations so it's not obvious
- Configurable settings for different play styles

## Later Updates (v0.4.0 - v0.5.0)
### Smart Auto Farming
- Intelligent farming that detects good opportunities
- If someone drops a luck totem, automatically go there and farm (with user permission)
- Detect other events that give better rewards
- Only move if it makes sense (not gonna walk across the map for 2% extra loot)

### Equipment Stuff
- Auto craft system for making gear
- Auto grind equipment upgrades
- Smart material usage so you don't waste stuff

## GUI Rewrite (v0.6.0+)
### New Interface
- Working on a completely new GUI from scratch
- Should be way better than the current one
- Better mobile support

### Config Management (depends on new GUI)
- Save and load different profiles
- Import/export settings
- Multiple preset configurations
- Basically proper config management instead of the current mess
